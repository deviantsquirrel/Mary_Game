//Spoilers below

In the first level the protagonist meets an old lady using the magical compass that they find in the first location. They must help her find her way home by slowing a riddle. Later at her home they must help her with several household choirs. The old lady is waiting for her daughters visit but instead her old neighbor comes by. The protagonist tells the neighbor of their memory troubles, and they play a board game. When the neighbor inevitably leaves the teenager is left alone with the lady. She will refuse to let the kid go, before her family arrives, claiming that they must meet. The player must discover her story through the clues left around the apartment and learn that her family will never come here. Then they can confront the lady directly or use a trick to get her to open the door. 
 In the second level the player meets a young woman who asks them to babysit her little brother while she’s away. Since the compass is acting up again and wouldn’t show the way to go the teenager agrees to do so. The player can go ahead and just do the task given by the woman and reach one of the endings for the level. Alternatively, the player can look around the house and learn what happened to the family from the clues hidden around and from playing with the child. If the player discovers the basement and solve the riddles down there, they can reach the other two endings. 
In the end of the game, it’s revealed that the protagonist has suffered a fatal accident before the game started. And now they are in a state in-between life and death when life flashes before their eyes. The five levels of the game represent the five stages of acceptance: denial, anger, bargain, depression, and acceptance. Each level has a main character who represents that state.  Their life story also has similarities to the one of the protagonists helping them remember. As they move forward remembering more and more, they are also dying. Their brain is deteriorating causing the images to become more disturbed, the graphics darker. The reality breaks apart, the laws of physics become less and less strict.
